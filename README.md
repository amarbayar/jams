JAMS
====
Job Application Management System

The 4 of us (Adiya Bayansan, Shohrab Hossain, Sadakul Islam and myself Amarbayar Amarsanaa) started this project to tackle two issues:

1. Final Project for Web Application Architecture at MUM 
2. Build a system that will make our job hunting process much easier when we start looking for a job. 

With this being said, JAMS, is a system where we can keep track of our job applications, track their progress of different phases (resume step, phone interview step, 
technical interview step, onsite interview step...etc), maintain a list of companies we are interested in applying along with recruiters' contact information, and 
schedule events and reminders for meetings and interviews. 

Today, students mainly use Excel spreadsheet to keep track of where they applied, who the recruiters are, and what phase they are in. Maintaining a spreadsheet can become 
a complicated task, not to mention the possibility of accidentally deleting the file, loosing it, or having a corrupt file. JAMS comes in to our aide to solve all these problems. 

Let's JAM it, not excel it! :)
